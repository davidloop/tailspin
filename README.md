# Tailspin

Tailspin is a customizable, class-based, utility-first CSS library that helps you work within the constraints of a unified system, instead of littering style sheets with arbitrary values. Itâ€™s purpose is to help with rapid front-end style development, which is based on consistent design patterns. It can work with any other framework or library such as Bootstrap or React.

Tailspin acts as a single source library of truth, for repeating utility styles in your code.

### How To Use

Choose a Tailspin CSS type for your project. You can either use all of Tailspin, or pick and choose multiple or individual utilities, helpers, and/or modifiers. 
Each type has its very own CSS file.
